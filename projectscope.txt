Here's how I'd suggest these colors could be used:

Primary (Dark Blue): This color can be used for important elements like headers, footers, and buttons. It can also be used for text and links.

Secondary (Bright Red): Use this as an accent color to draw attention to key areas like call-to-action buttons, important notifications, or highlighted text.

Blue-Infused Black: This can be used for the website's main text to provide a softer contrast against the white background. It's also great for icons and other minor elements.

Blue-Infused White: This can be the main background color for your website. It gives the site a brighter, more inviting feel while maintaining a cohesive look with the rest of the color palette.

Blue-Infused Grey: This color is perfect for secondary text, borders, and backgrounds of secondary content areas. It can also be used for disabled buttons or inputs.
